# Scrapbook

A digital scrapbook which creates an exciting way for users to make memories by collecting or creating badges to display their personal travels or achievements. There will be preset badges that users can collect such as yearly badges, state badges, country badges and continent badges etc. Users will also have the option to create their own that they can share with family and friends or communities. This might include a couple creating a badge for their own wedding and sharing it with their guests, a graduating class voting on a badge design to represent their year, events creating a badge for the attendees i.e. a world cup badge for people that attended the world cup, a musician releasing a badge for one of their tours, or even a new store releasing a badge for a grand opening.

Badges will act as albums that users can store pictures in as a way to remember the timeline of when they collected said badge. Users will also have the option to link badges with one another to create mega albums to display all the pictures that took together.

Down the line physical scrapbooks will be released that have a QR code which can be scanned and it will open a portfolio of all the badges that they've collected. QR codes may be extended to badges which will display the album of pictures but due to privacy reasons this feature may or may not be included unless a condition is met which gives access to certain users.

Users may have the option to customize their scrapbooks such that they reflect different time periods in their life 0-18, 18-22 (college), 22+ or if they want to collect badges with someone else i.e. a scrapbook with a friend/partner or a family scrapbook that parents can start from when they get married to having kids to when their kids have kids etc. Scrapbooks can also be linked to people in the same family to create family tree so families are able to see the history before them.

Scrapbook will also provide suggestions as to what other badges a user might want to collect depending on their current portfolio and allow local businesses to promote their own badges that they want to share. 

There will also be an option to journal in the scrapbook or write an autobiography. Scrapbook is meant to be much more than just collecting badges and storing pictures but also a way to pass down our history to future generations. This is why it will be a goal to sponsor schools in the future by giving kids these scrapbooks that they will have for a lifetime and they will be able to pass down their history so it's never lost.
