## To do later after creating User/Scrapbook/Badges
1. Store login token/info after initially logging in 
2. Do some research on what page templates to use
3. Create widgets in separate files and successfully import them into new files
4. Store a user's past locations and identify the states they were in,
then create a list to see which states they've visted

# Find a way to set the location as the app is launching so it doesn't get stuck at 0.0/0.0

## Creating Profiles
1. Created a Profile with users
2. Initialize a Scrapbook object when a User is created
3. The Scrapbook object should have a hashmap/list of Badges

## Storing a login token so users don't need to keep signing in
1. Create a sign out option to test later requirements
2. Develop a mechanism to enable automatic sign-in functionality if a user opts in
3. Save a token to the user's device that lets them skip the sign in page and takes them to the
home page right away.
4. If the user signs out the token is deleted and they will be asked to enter their login credentials again
5. Implement email verification using Firebase to ensure that only valid and authorized emails can be used

** Storing a login token so users don't need to keep signing in
1. Created a temporary sign out button in global_page.dart to sign the user out using FirebaseAuth
2. Added a checkbox in the login page to keep the user signed in if they so chose. If the checkbox was checked,
the key "Check" in shared_preferences will be used to determine if a a user will stay logged in.



Questions??
- If I have already preset badges (states, countries, continents) how would I
add it to a user's profile when it has been obtained? Do I create all the preset
badges and then set its boolean value to true when it's unlocked or do I wait until 
a badge is unlocked to create the badge object?
- What are same ways to add error handling when the app crashes? Should there be an
option which just refreshes the entire app or should the app just close on its own?
