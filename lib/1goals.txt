## To do later after creating User/Scrapbook/Badges
1. Store login token/info after initially logging in 
2. Do some research on what page templates to use
3. Create widgets in separate files and successfully import them into new files
4. Store a user's past locations and identify the states they were in,
then create a list to see which states they've visted

# Find a way to set the location as the app is launching so it doesn't get stuck at 0.0/0.0

## Creating Profiles
1. Created a Profile with users
2. Initialize a Scrapbook object when a User is created
3. The Scrapbook object should have a hashmap/list of Badges

## Storing a login token so users don't need to keep signing in
1. Create a sign out option to test later requirements
2. Create a way to detect if a user has opted to stay signed in on their device
after opting in
3. Add a sign out button on global_page in case a user wants to sign out of their account





Questions??
- If I have already preset badges (states, countries, continents) how would I
add it to a user's profile when it has been obtained? Do I create all the preset
badges and then set its boolean value to true when it's unlocked or do I wait until 
a badge is unlocked to create the badge object?
- What are same ways to add error handling when the app crashes? Should there be an
option which just refreshes the entire app or should the app just close on its own?
